 I'm Debbie, a soon-to-graduate Computer Science student with a burning passion for code and crafting beautiful, user-centric experiences. While I might be fresh out of academia, I'm no stranger to the world of web and app development.
                    
                    Self-taught and eager to learn, I've honed my skills in various languages like Python (my trusty sidekick!), React (building those dynamic interfaces!), Java (for some backend muscle), and of course, the inseparable duo of HTML and CSS (laying the foundation). But my journey doesn't stop there.
                    
                    I'm a firm believer that design is just as important as functionality. That's why I've immersed myself in the world of UI design, becoming comfortable with Figma and its power to turn ideas into stunning visuals. âœ¨
                    
                    This portfolio is my showcase, a testament to my dedication and growth. Explore my projects, from sleek web applications to engaging mobile apps, and see how I translate complex concepts into user-friendly, visually captivating experiences.
                    
                    I'm not just a developer; I'm a problem solver, a collaborator, and a storyteller who uses code and design to bring ideas to life. I'm eager to jump into the tech world and contribute my skills to projects that make a difference.
                    
                    So, grab a coffee (or your preferred coding fuel!), browse my portfolio, and let's connect! I'm always up for discussing tech, design, or anything in between.
                    
                    Excited to hear from you
